# Slide 1

Hello, my name is Alice, and I am here with Nicola and Kevin to introduce our project named Route Rocket.

# Slide 2

Route Rocket is a web platform where users can book car trips offered by users registered as drivers.

We have three types of users: the passenger, the driver, and the administrator.

Let's explore what each can do through the use cases. 

# Slide 3

As we can see, the unregistered user can only perform the registration. 

Once completed, he becomes  *(becoms)* a registered user who can login, logout, and view his personal information. The driver instead can make their car available for earning money through the passenger trips.

The passenger can book a trip, view driver information in charge *(ciarg)* of the trip, write reviews, and check active and past reservations.

The driver can manage reservations, view statistics, and request a pick-up location for passengers.

Finally, the administrator can manage *(m√®neig)* users and approve locations proposed by drivers.

# Slide 8

We chose to implement a responsive web application. To achieve this, we decided to use two frameworks: Angular JS that is a Javascript Framework TailwindCSS that is a CSS Framework.
